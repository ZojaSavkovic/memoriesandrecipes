*This is a guest post in Persian by a friend. We had just shared and meal and were looking at the sunset, content with the meal we had had, when I brought up this quote, which is misattributed to (but inspired by) the Persian poet Hafez.*

Even  
After  
All this time  
The Sun never says to the Earth,  
"You owe me."  

Look  
What happens  
With a love like that,  
It lights the whole sky.
