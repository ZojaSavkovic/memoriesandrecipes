*From spare peanut butter in my last post, to spare cinnamon... what to use if for other than cinnamon rolls!*

Continuing on my journey of breads and pastries - I have made cinnamon scrolls! I had a lot of spare cinnamon, and thought that 2 tablespoons in this [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/12/bravetart-homemade-cinnamon-rolls-recipe.html) is a good amount to start using it up, one recipe at a time. I follow this recipe by [BraveTart](https://www.seriouseats.com/editors/stella-parks), which includes a total of 30 minutes of stand mixer use.

I think that these actually taste better the day after baking, either hot or cold, as the flavour seeps in to the dough - similar to how lasagna can often taste better the day after baking too.

Here is my first attempt:

The second time I made them, I made thinner ones, so needed more tray space too - think I prefer them thinner!

There is a lot of butter in this recipe and you will find it at the bottom of the cooking tray... delicious butter!
