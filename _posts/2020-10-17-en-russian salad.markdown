*A delicious though not so healthy "salad" - here is the recipe for an addictive russian salad!*

Wikipedia says this is a traditional salad dish in Russian cuisine, which is also popular in other post-Soviet countries, and that the original version of the salad was invented in the 1860s by a cook of Belgian origin, Lucien Olivier, in Russia. So it is also called Olivier salad. It also says that in Croatia and Slovenia it is typically prepared without meat, and is usually called French salad. While in Bosnia and Herzegovina both the Russian salad and French salad are very popular, especially during holidays.

It does go deliciously with the kiflice from the last [post](http://memoriesandrecipes.com/recipe/2020/10/10/en-kiflice.html)!
