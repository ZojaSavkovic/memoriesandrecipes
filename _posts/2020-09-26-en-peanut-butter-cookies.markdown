*I had spare peanut butter lying around, and thought to make cookies to use it up. Now I specifically buy peanut buter to make these cookies!*

Well 2020 is turning out to be a unique year! I found myself making [these](https://www.bestrecipes.com.au/recipes/peanut-butter-cookies-recipe/fowk6kuy) cookies, or a variation of it, at least once a week for several months.

Variations include adding dried fig, walnuts, crushed plain biscuits and chocolate chips - I had some spares of these when I did my fig roll post (link), and liked the roll so much that I wanted to make a cookie flavour of it.
