*Poppy seeds. They have this taste. Just like sesame seeds have their taste. I was intrigued when I bought a poppy seed slice at a German bakery recently. I then decided to search around for recipes with poppy seeds. A cake seemed like a sensible entry level decision. I have made a poppy seed cake twice now, recipe below.*

My second attempt in a round tin is more glamorous and gets the top picture spot!

6. Pour in to a greased, lined 20 cm springform pan and bake for 1 hour, or until just firm.
7. Stand for 5 minutes, then turn out on to a plate and cool.
8. Melt the dark chocolate with the pouring cream.
9. Cool for 20 minutes, then spread over the cake.

The first time I made it I used a square tin, shovelled it in to a lunch box and brought it along to a Christmas in July country escape and it was a hit. The picture below by the woodfire in the background captures the moment. It was apt for a Christmas theme, as searching online, it is a Ukrainian custom at Christmas.

To finish, a picture of the poppy seed slice that I bought at a German bakery that started my adventure.
