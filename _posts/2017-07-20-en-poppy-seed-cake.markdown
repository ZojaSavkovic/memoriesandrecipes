*Poppy seeds. I love the taste. My taste was rekindled when I bought a poppy seed slice at a German Bakery recently. I then decided to search around for inspiration of base recipes and ingredients for anything with poppy seeds. A cake seemed like a sensible entry level decision. I have made a poppy seed cake twice now, and decided to share my master recipe that works for me.*

My second attempt in a round tin is more glamorous and gets the top picture spot!

The first time I made it I used a square tin, shovelled it in to a lunch box and brought it along to a Christmas in July country escape and it was a hit. The picture below by the woodfire captures the moment. It was apt for a Christmas theme, as searching online, it is a Ukrainian custom at Christmas.
