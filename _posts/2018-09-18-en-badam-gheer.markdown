*Another restaurant, another delicious drink successfully discovered. Madras Bros in Melbourne in Fitzroy served up an array of drinks, including Badam Gheer which I’ve tried to recreate at home.*

Almond in Hindi and Persian languages is Badam, while in Serbo-Croatian it's Badem. This drink called Badam Gheer definitely has almond in it.

To make this drink, I used a spice and nut grinder, which also came in handy for Lebkuchengewürz, and could be used for Chai. All great excuses to invest in a spice grinder, it really pulverises spices! And grinds nuts.

I used cinnamon as decoration, as it is quicker than pan frying pieces of various nuts for decoration, which is often done.

**Ingredients**

* 1/4 cup almonds
* 3 pieces green cardamom
* 3 strands of saffron
* 3 cups milk
* 3 tbsp honey
* cinnamon, for decoration

**Steps**

1. Pour boiling water over almonds and soak for 4 hours.
2. Skin almonds.
3. Place almonds, cardamom and saffron in spice grinder. Pulse a few times, and then continuously grind until consistent. Milk can be added to help the mixture become consistent.
4. In a medium saucepan on medium heat, boil the milk.
5. Add the almond mixture and bring to a boil, then simmer until consistency is thick.
6. Pour drink, and decorate with cinnamon.

This makes 3 small servings.

Having made this a few times now, I will agree with something I’ve read many times about saffron. If you can taste it in the dish, you have added too much!
