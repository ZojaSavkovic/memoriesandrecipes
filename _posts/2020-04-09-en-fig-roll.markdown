*Crumbed biscuits, chocolate, fig and walnuts... this is one of my all time favourite desserts.*

But to make it, you need to find wafer sheets (which ice cream cones are made of), which are quite a rare find. I have found them in a deli though.

This is quite time intensive and requires a lot of chopping!

This makes 4 rolls.

**Materials**

* 5 clean tea towels, as large as the wafer sheets
* Aluminium foil

**Ingredients**

* 400g dried figs (you can add more or less according to taste, or even add 100g of sultanas or other dried fruits, e.g. apricots)
* 300g walnuts
* 300g plain biscuits (preferably one which will crush easily)
* half a cup of water
* 300g milk cooking chocolate 
* half a cup or less of sugar
* 250g unsalted butter
* 4 wafer sheets around 40cmx30cm each

**Steps**

1. Soak the clean tea towels in warm water. Wring out excess water.
2. Lay out the first tea towel on a clean flat surface. Place the wafer sheet on top of that. Place another tea towel on top, then another wafer sheet and so on. This is necessary to make the wafer sheets flexible for rolling later on.
3. Cut figs into small pieces (and all other dry fruit, eg sultanas.)
4. Cut walnuts into small pieces.
5. Crush biscuits with rolling pin. An easy way to do this is to put a small amount of biscuits in to a zip lock bag at a time, and crush them inside the bag.
6. Mix: crushed biscuits, walnuts, figs (and other dried fruit) in a bowl.
7. Heat water, chocolate, sugar and butter on stove until the chocolate and butter melt.
8. Pour melted chocolate mixture (from step 7) into the bowl with crushed biscuits, walnuts, figs (and other dried fruit) (from step 6).
9. Cut a piece of aluminium foil, about the size of a wafer sheet (preferably bigger on the ends).
10. Place aluminium foil flat. On the aluminium foil place a damp wafer sheet.
11. Divide chocolate/fruit mixture (from step 8) into 4 parts so that there will be enough for 4 wafer sheets.
12. Place one part of the chocolate/fruit mixture (from step 8) on the damp wafer sheet. Spread the mixture out, keeping in mind you will need to roll it in the next step.
13. Roll the wafer only, and not the aluminium foil. If the wafer does not roll easily but starts to break, you can spray warm water on to the wafer to dampen it. Once the wafer rolled up, wrap the aluminium foil around the wafer, and twist the ends of the foil to seal it in foil.
14. Repeat steps 12-14 for the other 3 rolls.
15. Place all 4 rolls in the fridge/freezer. When they cool down, they are ready to be eaten. Cut them in to slices to serve.
16. Enjoy!
