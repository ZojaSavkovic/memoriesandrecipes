*I've only had a handful of fine dining experiences. The restaurant Pendolino is one, and it sits just above Sydney's colourful Strand arcade. Finding it feels like finding a hidden treasure.*

The first thing to notice once inside is the soft lighting. The second is the bread and olive oil, which they are famous for.

As expected, each part of each dish was made to perfection. The menu certainly holds many more dishes to wish for!
