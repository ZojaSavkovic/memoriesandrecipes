*I had a four tomato salad when eating out recently and it was the best. So I decided to make my own.*

But before that - what are tomateos anyway? Wikipedia says tomatoes are the often red berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum. That got me thinking about all the tomato types out there. Apparently there are more than 10,000 varieties.

So I went to a few supermarkets and found all of the following - warning, this is the rest of this paragraph: Gourmet, Truss (with the green vine), Kumato, also available in grape, 
Sweet berry truss, Munchkin Tomato Medley, plain “tomato” sometimes called “fresh tomato”, Cocktail truss, Greenhouse truss, Roma truss baby, Field tomato, Cherry Burst, Perino, Perino gold, Grape perino, Vine Ripened, also available in cherry, Solanto, Cherry, Roma, also available in grape, mini and baby, Baby Roma Truss Tomatoes, Romatherapy Baby Roma, Toma’Muse.

That's a lot of tomatoes! I ended up buying the first four mentioned. In the first picture, you can see the two red large tomatoes familiar to all - the Truss in the middle, and the Gourmet behind it. To the right of the gourmet is the tomato medley - the dark red, orange and yellow ones. At the front are the sweet berry truss, and to the left of them are the Kumato grape ones.

I already eat tomatoes most days for both lunch and dinner. Now I've got an eye for trying more varieties. I don't think I'll reach more than 10,000, but I can try!
