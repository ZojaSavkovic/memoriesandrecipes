This blog is about three things for me - food, language and software.

**Food:** Glorious food. It’s about my past memories, recipes and experiences eating out.

**Language:** It’s about me painstakingly translating each page in to a number of languages that I speak. Because it’s easy to forget a language and I’d rather not forget what I know currently. It's part of who I am, how I grew up, and I would be sad to see those parts of me fade away. I have guest posts by friends in additional languages too!

**Software:** It’s about me learning software. I use Jekyll as a static site generator, with the site being hosted for free with GitHub pages. You can view all the source code for my site on my [GitHub](https://github.com/zojasavkovic) account. I built upon an open source [template](http://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/) that I found.
